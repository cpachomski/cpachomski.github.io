**[My Personal Website](http://cpachomski.github.io)** built using Jekyll for static blog pages. I'll add animations and other fun things as the project grows

## That Purpose Though

* Keep track of things I learn
* Work on my writing/ability to convey knowledge
* Fun
* Try new things
* Jekyll is great for bloggin
